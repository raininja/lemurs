Lemurs is a *Terminal User Interface* (TUI) [Display/Login
Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager) written in Rust that
works on most GNU/Linux and BSD distributions. It can work both
*with or without* SystemD. This fork is for [Obarun Linux](http://web.obarun.org) or any distro running 66. 

## Goal

This project creates a small, robust and yet customizable Login Manager which
can serve as the front-end to your TTY, X11 or Wayland sessions. Lemurs uses
[_Pluggable Authentication Modules_][pam] (PAM) as its method of authentication.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/lemurs.svg)](https://repology.org/project/lemurs/versions)

Installation follows three steps.

1. Compile the codebase
2. Copy all files to correct positions
3. Enable `init` process to run `lemurs`

### Obarun Linux 

Lemurs can be installed from the [obcommunity](http://web.obarun.org/index.php?id=140)  repository.

```bash
sudo pacman -S lemurs


Alternatively, [lemurs-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lemurs-git) is available in the AUR.

### Compiling from source

On ArchLinux based distributions, the functionality of the install.sh script usually packaged with Lemurs is provided by the distro, or the PKGBUILD. 



Although you might first want to set up some window managers (see
[Usage](#Usage)), upon rebooting you should now see Lemurs.

## Usage

After installation you can add your environments by creating runnable scripts.

For your Xorg put your [xinitrc](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xinit) scripts
in the `/etc/lemurs/wms` directory. For Wayland, put a script that starts your
compositor in the `/etc/lemurs/wayland` directory. For both cases, the name of
the runnable script file is the name that is shown in the environment switcher
within lemurs. Multiple Xorg and Wayland environments can exist at the same time.

### Example 1: BSPWM

For the [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window manager, you might
add the script `/etc/lemurs/wms/bspwm`.

```bash
#! /bin/sh
sxhkd &
exec bspwm
```

Remember to make this script runnable. This is done with the `sudo chmod 755
/etc/lemurs/wms/bspwm` command.

Upon rebooting your new `bspwm` should show up within Lemurs.

### Example 2: Sway

For the [sway](https://swaywm.org/) compositor and window manager, you might
add the script `/etc/lemurs/wayland/sway`. Ensure that you have sway installed
and added yourself to the `seat` group.

```bash
#! /bin/sh
exec sway
```

Remember to make this script runnable. This is done with the `sudo chmod 755
/etc/lemurs/wayland/sway` command.

Upon rebooting your new `sway` should show up within Lemurs.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through a [TOML] file. By default, Lemurs searches for a
`/etc/lemurs/config.toml` file, but an alternative location can be specified
using the `--config <path/to/config.toml>` flag. The configuration type can
contain any subset of the available options. All the options and explanations
as to what they do can be found in the
[`extra/config.toml`](./extra/config.toml) file. This file also serves as the
default configuration.

Additionally, there is the possibility of variables in the configuration file.
By default, Lemurs searches for a `/etc/lemurs/variables.toml` file, but an
alternative location can be specified using the `--variables
<path/to/variables.toml`. The `variables.toml` file may contain key-value pairs
which can be referenced from within the main `config.toml` file. 

Below shows an example of how the `variables.toml` and `config.toml` file
interact.

```toml
# variables.toml
replacement_char = "+"
show_pw_title = true
password_title = "Password :)"
title_color = "white"

# config.toml
[password_field]
content_replacement_character = "$replacement_char"

[password_field.style]
show_title = "$show_pw_title"
title = "Wow a $password_title"
title_color = "$title_color"
```

This will be interpreted as:

```toml
[password_field]
content_replacement_character = "+"

[password_field.style]
show_title = true
title = "Wow a Password :)"
title_color = "white"
```

## Preview & Debugging

Lemurs logs a lot of information of it running to a logging file. There are 3
log files.

- `/var/log/lemurs.log`: This is the main log file that contains information
  about the control flow and is the first place you should look.
- `/var/log/lemurs.client.log`: This is the `stdout` and `stderr` of your
  environment. This can help you debug your scripts in the `/etc/lemurs/wms` or
  `/etc/lemurs/wayland` folder.
- `/var/log/lemurs.xorg.log`: This is the `stdout` and `stderr` of the X server.
  This is only used when you run a X11 based environment.

You can disable logging with the `--no-log` flag. This flag can be adding into
your service manager script if you want to disable logging globally.

If you want to test the UI generated by your configuration file you can also run
`lemurs --preview`. This will run a preview instance of your configuration. This
will automatically create a `lemurs.log` in the working directory.
